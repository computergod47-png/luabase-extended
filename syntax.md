#variables
#you can use static type
int x = 10
#or dynamic type
x = 10
#supports: int,float,boolean,str

#prints
print("hello ", x, "\n")
#does not automatically place \n at the end of prints, you need to manually do it.

#loops and ifs

#Syntax changes in v2.2.0:
- Function declaration changed:
`function myfunc(){}` instead of `function myfunc() end`

- C library logic changed:
Add libraries by changing `self.headers=` in the compiler.
Change the `subprocess.run("clang", ...)` to link your libraries
Libraries already hardcoded in the python script:
  stdio.h
  stdlib.h
  time.h
  unistd.h
  math.h

No need for writing `extern` now, just call the function like:
`CreateWindow(800,600,"Title")`
- Can call anything in C you like:
Except for stuff that the compiler thinks that is in luaBase, you can basically use any C feature you want.
Like:
`struct Player {...}`
#############################
#Syntax Changes in 2.3.0:
new keyword added: `link`
`link` is basically the same as `#include`
You need to tell the compiler your include directories with `<compile_command> -l"PATH/TO/INCLUDE/DIRECTORY`
For linking libraries, add: `<compile_command> -g"PATH/TO/LIBRARY"` in your compile command
Also, the `link` `-l` version uses .h files.
#alrighty byeee
